JSON-PARSER
===

This is a simple `json` parser for C language written in flex/bison. The parser
is currently under development and will be ready to use as soon as possible.  
The goal is to write an advanced `json` toolkit with capabilities listed below:

- [ ] Read JSON files, parse them, and provide the result in a data-structure.
- [ ] Read YAML files, parse them, and provide the result in a data-structure.
- [ ] Create JSON/YAML objects in C, stringify them, and save them to files.
- [ ] Beautify/Uglify JSON files using API/Command Line.
- [ ] Perform `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `findIndex` on JSON arrays.
- [ ] Convert a JSON object to its `entries` array.
- [ ] Convert an `entries` array to a JSON object.
